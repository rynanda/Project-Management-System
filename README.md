# Project Management System
Managing a list of tasks in a project using data structures and algorithms. Identifying significant abstract data types (ADTs) in a real-world application, designing and implementing the identified ADTs, then using the ADTs to build a real-world application. Applying algorithms (topological sort and depth first search) to solve computational problems arising from the ADT implementations and application building.
